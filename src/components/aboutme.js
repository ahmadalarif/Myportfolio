                <p style={{fontSize: '20px', fontFamily: 'Oxygen'}}>My passion for web development was sparked in my previous career as sales. I find great satisfaction in being able to solve many system technical issues, such as managing systems data. I continued my journey of solving systems issues in Saudi Telecom Company while I was a sales supervisor for six years. Currently, I am a software engineer that has skills in both the back-end of web applications and the front-end. My previous career as a sales supervisor brought me close to my true passion: building web applications. I wasn’t satisfied with only being involved in the visual aspect, and wanted a deeper involvement in building out applications. In the next phase of my career, I not only want to use my design skills to make the application look beautiful, but I also want to work on the technically challenging facets of the application too.
